# Fake-News-Prediction
This repository contains code for predicting fake news using logistic regression. The dataset provided includes columns such as ID, title, text, and label, where the label indicates whether the news is fake or real.
Fake news prediction involves the use of machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques to analyze content and predict the likelihood that a given piece of information is fake or real.
## Preprocessing
- Text data underwent preprocessing, including:
  - Performing stemming to reduce words to their root form.
## Setup
To run the code, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the appropriate directory.
## Usage
1. Load the dataset and preprocess the data, including any necessary cleaning and feature engineering steps.
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Train a logistic regression model on the training data.
4. Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Adjust model hyperparameters if necessary to improve performance.
